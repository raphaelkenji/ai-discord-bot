# ai-discord-bot

This is my attempt at making my own discord bot for conversations with OpenAI models (mainly GPT-4). This idea has been inspired by [cmyui](https://github.com/cmyui)'s project, you can find his repository [here](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/ai-discord-bot).

Compatibility:
- gpt-4.5-turbo (maybe?)
- gpt-4
- gpt-3.5-turbo

TODO:
- improve db (also upload scripts);
- improve code overall (its bad);
- implement more oai functionalities;
- remove whitelist (maybe?).
